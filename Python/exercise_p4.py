    In this exerices, we will implement transitions.
    The salamander robot needs to perform swimming to walking
    and walking to swimming transitions.

    Hint:
        - set the  arena to 'amphibious'
        - use the sensor(gps) values to find the point where
        the robot should transition
        - simulation can be stopped/played in the middle
        by pressing the space bar
        - printing or debug mode of vscode can be used
        to understand the sensor values
