- output x = r(1+cos(theta))? what is this x?
- 30 limb projected to all?
- why backward walk?
- simu_param (exo_ex) -> ampli?

- k changes -> should change weights pi limb-spine too (esp for walking)?
- exo2: ".._test" fun, for what?
- exo2.3: qualitative or grid search? phase_lag => just phi1-phi2 (in exo1)?
- exo2: where links_vel?
- how to stop simu entirely?
- plot_results: what is plot 2D for? grid search results?
- exo2: metrics -> energy ok? or ratio perhaps?

- exo3.1: compare to body deform -> wtf?
- exo3.1: uncertainty in plot no sense does it?
- exo3.1: for phase_lag 2 goes backward, not so in paper normal?
- exo3.2: ditch fixed dependency drive - body ampli?
- otherwise other param (connection weights...) cst?

- exo4: spine and limb phases, not x?
- how to make land/water environment? transition/tilt? and how?

- exo1: what to explain?
